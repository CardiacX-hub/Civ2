# Civ2 — Kingdoms at War


A dependency-free 2D browser RTS. Run `npm start`, then open the served game on port 3000. Run `npm test` for simulation smoke tests.

Choose the human **Dawnward** or the orc/troll **The Dominion**, customize banners, and play against one or two AI opponents. Each side begins with a stronghold and four collectors. Victory requires destroying every opposing stronghold; losing your own ends the game.

Click or drag to select friendly units. Shift-click adds to selection. After selecting units, click **Move / command** (or press **M**), then click ground to move, an enemy to attack, or lumber/gold to gather. Right-click also issues these orders. A destination ring and message confirm the order. Collectors construct buildings from the command panel. Buildings begin as construction sites and require a nearby collector until completed. Finished production buildings train units through timed queues. WASD or arrows pan the camera; clicking the minimap recenters it. Escape cancels placement. Pause freezes the simulation.

- Stronghold: collectors.
- Infantry Lodge: durable melee, balanced ranged, and fragile high-damage ranged infantry.
- Siege Works: slow artillery with splash damage.
- Sky Roost: fast flying units.
- Hero Sanctum: one unique faction hero. Dawnward Sun Marshal grants 30% damage reduction within 190 units. Ashfang Stormcaller grants 30% attack damage within 190 units.
- Harvest Guild: three gathering-speed upgrades.
- Infantry Armory: three infantry attack and armor upgrades.
- Artillery Foundry: three artillery damage upgrades.

The unexplored map stays hidden. Explored areas dim outside friendly sight; enemies only appear when currently visible, with red dots on the minimap. AI collects, constructs, trains, upgrades, and attacks after building an army. Ground units route around walls; other scenery uses direct movement; flying units have distinctive visuals and faster movement, and all combat units can attack air targets. Resources are credited while collectors gather rather than transported to base.

No accounts, secrets, external services, or build step are required.

## Publish and play on GitHub Pages

The game runs directly in a browser; GitHub Pages does not need Node.js.

1. Open this repository on GitHub and go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Open **Actions → Publish game to GitHub Pages → Run workflow** on `main`. Subsequent pushes to `main` publish automatically.
4. When deployment completes, open **https://cardiacx-hub.github.io/Civ2/** to play.

For local play, run `npm start` and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Unit artwork and rally points

Units have faction-specific armor, leather details, weapons, walking cycles, and flying mounts with animated wings. Collectors swing axes while chopping lumber and pickaxes while mining gold. Melee units swing their weapons; ranged units fire arrows, spears, bullets, or magical bolts; siege engines recoil or launch rocks. Animations pause with the simulation.

Select a Stronghold, Infantry Lodge, Siege Works, Sky Roost, or Hero Sanctum and choose **Set rally point**, then click the destination. Right-clicking with a production building selected also sets its rally point. A flag and dashed line identify the destination while the building is selected. Newly trained units automatically move there. A Stronghold rallied to a visible tree or gold deposit assigns its new collectors to gather that resource. **Clear rally point** restores spawning beside the building. Existing units keep their current orders.

## Defenses and battle effects

Select a collector to build a **Watchtower** (140 gold, 160 lumber) or **Siege Bastion** (280 gold, 240 lumber). Watchtowers have 1,000 health and fire every 1.1 seconds for 22 damage within 290 units, including at flying enemies. Siege Bastions have 1,600 health and fire every 2.6 seconds for 60 damage within 340 units, with reduced splash damage to nearby enemies. Defenses target enemies automatically without friendly fire. Select a defense to see its attack radius. AI opponents also build defenses. Human defenses use stone battlements; Dominion defenses use timber, spikes, and tribal banners.

Detailed troop artwork includes riveted armor, leather aprons, ammunition pouches, quivers, mount scales, and siege machinery. Attacks display swing trails, impact sparks, muzzle smoke, magical particles, and explosions. Chopping produces wood chips; mining produces gold and stone sparks. Effects respect fog of war and pause, and their count is capped for performance.

## Group selection and scenery

Double-click a friendly unit to select **all living friendly units of that exact type currently on screen**. Offscreen units are excluded. Shift-double-click adds that type to your current selection. Enemy entities are excluded. Double-clicking a friendly building selects all onscreen buildings of its exact type. You can click the head or body of a unit to select it.

The battlefield features cached grass and soil textures, moss, pebbles, flowers, varied tree canopies, bark, and faceted gold deposits. Buildings feature stone or timber courses, tiled roofs, doors, windows, moving faction banners, and specialized details such as turning harvest-mill blades, glowing sanctum crystals, smoking forge chimneys, and sky-roost nests.

## Directional poses, attack targeting, and walls

Troops are now polygon-based 3D models, projected into the 2D battlefield with directional lighting and depth-sorted faces. Their bodies rotate continuously, including all eight compass directions. Articulated limbs and equipment animate during movement, work, and attacks.

With troops selected, click an enemy to attack, or use the Move / command button and click an enemy. Right-click also works. Hovered enemies and active attack targets show red rings; confirmed attack orders have a red destination marker. Targets remain marked while selected troops attack them and the enemy is visible.

Collectors can build **Wall** segments for 15 gold and 35 lumber each. Human walls have stone battlements; Dominion walls have spiked timber. Placement snaps to a 32-unit grid and stays active for consecutive segments; press Escape to finish. Each segment has 700 health and can be destroyed. Walls block ground troops of every faction; ground troops find paths around them, while flying troops pass over. Leave gaps for access—fully enclosed areas cannot be reached by ground troops until a wall is destroyed. Ranged weapons can fire over walls.

## Construction, spacing, and the global work queue

Units maintain spacing rather than stacking at a shared destination. Ground and air units occupy separate movement layers. Group commands use spaced formation destinations.

Select a collector and place a building site. The assigned builder travels to it and must remain nearby to advance construction; moving the builder away or losing it pauses progress. Right-click an unfinished friendly site with a collector selected to resume. Multiple wall sites queue on the assigned collector. Walls take 10 seconds each; other buildings take 30–65 seconds of on-site work. Incomplete buildings cannot train, research, attack, or block movement.

Upgrades take 25, 35, or 45 seconds and apply only when finished. Duplicate research of the same upgrade is prevented. The left **Production & Work** panel lists every friendly construction site, training queue entry, and active upgrade with a progress bar and timer. Resource gathering is excluded. Use its −/+ button to minimize or expand it. Queued troops show their estimated waiting time. Construction without a nearby builder displays its paused state.

Double-left-click a friendly building to select every friendly building of that type currently on screen. Troop training commands are routed to the selected completed building with the shortest queue. Setting a rally point applies to all selected production buildings.

## Economy, sequential tasks, minimap orders, and fire arrows

- Collectors take **20 seconds** to train. Each player has a **16-collector cap**, including collectors already queued at all Strongholds. Losses free capacity.
- Base harvesting is **0.75 gold or lumber per second**, with the Harvest Guild's existing upgrades increasing the rate. A tree supports one active collector; additional collectors seek nearby free trees or wait. Gold supports multiple collectors.
- **Shift-right-click**, or **Shift-left-click** on ground/resources/enemies with units selected, appends a task. Move waypoints finish on arrival, attacks finish when the target dies, gathering finishes when the resource runs out, and construction finishes when the site completes. Ordinary orders replace the sequence. Stop clears it. Shift placing a construction site queues it after current work.
- Clicking the **minimap with troops selected** sends them to that map location. Shift adds the minimap destination to their sequence. Right-click works too. With no troops selected, left-click pans the camera; **Alt-left-click** always pans. Production-building rally points can also be placed through the minimap using Set rally point or right-click.
- Snowcapped **mountain ranges** block construction and ground movement. Ground troops route around them; flying units pass over. Fog of war hides unexplored ranges, and discovered ranges appear on the minimap.
- Human players can research **Fire arrows** at the Infantry Armory for **200 gold, 150 lumber, and 35 seconds**. Longbow Rangers then fire flaming arrows that ignite enemies for **5 damage per second for 4 seconds**. Repeated hits refresh the burn rather than stacking it. Other infantry retain their normal weapons.

## Allegiance banners and lower starting resources

Every player now starts with **100 gold and 100 lumber**. Base gathering has been reduced another 75%, from 3 to **0.75 resources per second**; Harvest Guild upgrades still multiply that rate. Select a collector to order it to a nearby resource. Its selection ring turns **green while actively gathering**, and returns to its normal color when traveling, waiting, or doing another task.

The faction menu identifies your chosen allegiance in a banner. Dawnward's card shows an animated marching knight beneath a golden sun; the orc/troll faction is named **The Dominion** throughout the menu and opponent selectors, with an armored orc carrying an axe on its menu banner. Menu animation respects the browser's reduced-motion preference.
